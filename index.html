        Moment.js has been successfully used in millions projects, and we are
        happy to have contributed to making date and time better on the web. As
        of September 2020, Moment gets over 12 million downloads per week!
        However, Moment was built for the previous era of the JavaScript
        ecosystem. The modern web looks much different these days. Moment has
        evolved somewhat over the years, but it has essentially the same design
        as it did when it was created in 2011. Given how many projects depend on
        it, we choose to prioritize stability over new features.
