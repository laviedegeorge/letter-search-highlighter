			Moment.js has been successfully used in millions 
			projects, and we are happy to have contributed to
			making date and time better on the web. As of 
			September 2020, Moment gets over 12 million 
			downloads per week! However, Moment was built for
				the previous era of the JavaScript ecosystem. 
				The modern web looks much different these days. 
				Moment has evolved somewhat over the years, 
				but it has essentially the same design as it 
				did when it was created in 2011. Given how many 
				projects depend on it, we choose to prioritize 
				stability over new features.
